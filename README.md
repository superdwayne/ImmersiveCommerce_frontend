# Immersive Commerce 3D Product Viewer

## Overview
This project is a 3D product viewer built using React and Three.js with the help of React Three Fiber (R3F). It allows users to browse a collection of products in a 3D environment, applying filters to view different categories, and includes a loading animation that displays the percentage of the model loading progress.

## Features
- **3D Product Models**: Load and view 3D models in real-time using the GLTF format.
- **Loading Animation**: Displays a loading message along with the loading progress percentage.
- **Filter Options**: Filter products by categories such as Street and Fashion.
- **Navigation**: Easily navigate through products using next and previous buttons.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js that allows declarative use of Three.js.
- **Three.js**: A 3D library that makes WebGL simpler.
- **@react-three/drei**: A collection of useful helpers for R3F.
